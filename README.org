* image-roll.el

This package provides a virtual scroll engine for displaying books/documents in
Emacs. The main purpose of the package is to provide a continuous scrolling
feature when viewing documents. This is the successor of the
[[https://github.com/dalanicolai/pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el][pdf-continuous-scroll-mode package]]. Making it a new package (instead of an
update), was necessarry because this package provides a general 'display engine'
which can be used also by other packages, like doc-view.

This implementation of the image-roll/continuous-scroll is based on a correct
usage of vscroll, instead of using the vscroll functionality incorrectly
(causing Emacs crashes when viewing large documents, see [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-04/msg01234.html][this thread in the
Emacs devel archives]]). Additionally, this implementation is quite a bit simpler
and cleaner than previous implementations (e.g. the gap-overlays have been
eliminated).

The package is meant to be used in combination with some other package that
provides features to extract and manage the data from the document. An example
of such a package is the pdf-tools package as provided in the
[[https://github.com/dalanicolai/pdf-tools/tree/pdf-roll][the pdf-roll branch of my pdf-tools repo]].

The package is written in a way that it supports images/pages of different
sizes on the same roll (see comment above `image-roll-scroll-forward'). Also
there is no minumum or maximum on the range of the sizes, and finally, it is
written to support being displayed in (any number of) multiple windows.

This file provides four buffer local variables that should be set to the
values of the functions that correctly 'retrieve' the required data from the
document. See their docstrings and the `image-roll-directory' function (or
`pdf-scroll.el') for more info.

The core functionality, i.e. the 'scroll' is provided by the
`image-roll--new-window-function' and `image-roll--redisplay' functions. The
function `image-roll--new-window-function' should be added to the
`image-mode-new-window-functions' while the `image-roll--redisplay' should be
added to the `window-configuration-change-hook' both as buffer local hook
functions (i.e. by passing a non-nil LOCAL argument to `add-hook'). For the
`image-mode-new-window-functions' to have effect, the `image-mode-winprops'
should be initialized by either using `image-mode-setup-winprops' (like in
the body of `pdf-view-mode') or by initializing the
`image-mode-winprops-alist' explicitly (by setting its value to nil, like in
the `image-roll-mode' example).

** Donations
Donations are more than welcome, as I have been working many weeks/months on
this feature for zero, while I can not even afford to buy new socks without
holes. Thank you very much!

** Known issues
[[https://github.com/dalanicolai/image-roll.el/issues/4]]

** Todo
- See if we can cache page images in advance.
- Add support for 'sliced' images (in particular for
  =pdf-view-set-slice-from-bounding-box=)

** Installation and usage
Because there is still the issue, described just above, left, I am not yet
publishing this package on some package archive (or submit it to get included
into Emacs core). Therefore, it is up to you how you install this package, of
which the simplest way is to clone this repo or download the image-roll.el file,
and =load= it from you init file.

This does not provide any useful functionality by itself, but instead it is
meant to be used by some other package (see below).

*** Spacemacs users
Simply clone the private layer [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/pdf-layer][here]], then restart Spacemacs and update your
packages. Finally, from within a pdf buffer press ~c~ to activate displaying using
the image-roll.

*** Doom users
Don't use the =pdf= module, and add the following code to =packages.el=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! pdf-tools :recipe
          (:host github
                 :repo "dalanicolai/pdf-tools"
                 :branch "pdf-roll"
                 :files ("lisp/*.el"
                         "README"
                         ("build" "Makefile")
                         ("build" "server")
                         (:exclude "lisp/tablist.el" "lisp/tablist-filter.el"))))

(package! image-roll :recipe
          (:host github
                 :repo "dalanicolai/image-roll.el"))
#+end_src
then manually remove the old pdf-tools directory using:
#+begin_src bash
  rm -rf ~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/pdf-tools/
#+end_src

then run =doom sync -u = (if asked to delete origin remote and replace with new remote do so. If given the option to checkout pdf-roll also do this).

Finally, from some pdf buffer do =M-x pdf-view-roll-minor-mode= to get continuous
scrolling.

** Install complementary packages (support)
*** pdf-tools
A =pdf-tools= branch that implements =image-roll= support is available in [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/pdf-tools/tree/pdf-roll][the
pdf-roll branch of my pdf-tools fork]]. It is probably easiest to install it using
[[https://melpa.org/#/quelpa][quelpa]] or [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]]. I am a Spacemacs user, where I install the package (and also
image-mode) using the following code:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (pdf-tools :location (recipe
                        :fetcher github
                        :repo "dalanicolai/pdf-tools"
                        :branch "pdf-roll"
                        :files ("lisp/*.el"
                                "README"
                                ("build" "Makefile")
                                ("build" "server")
                                (:exclude "lisp/tablist.el" "lisp/tablist-filter.el"))))
  (image-roll :location (recipe
                         :fetcher github
                         :repo "dalanicolai/image-roll.el"))
#+end_src
From the above code example, I hope you are able to find out how to adapt it for
quelpa/straight. Contributions, e.g. of installation instructions, are very
welcome.

After successful installation, from a pdf buffer do =M-x pdf-view-roll-minor-mode=
to toggle displaying using the image roll.

Because the image-roll package is not yet available from an archive, I am not
creating a PR at pdf-tools yet.

*** doc-view
If you would like to also use the image-roll in doc-view, then simply download
and load [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/emacs/blob/doc-view-image-roll/lisp/doc-view.el][this doc-view.el file]]. After opening a file in =doc-view=, first WAIT
UNTIL ALL PAGES HAVE BEEN CONVERTED (see page counter at bottom of screen).
Subsequently do =M-x doc-view-roll-minor-mode= (for doc-view, currently only
activation of the minor mode has been implemented).

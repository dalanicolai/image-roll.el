;;; image-roll.el --- Virtual scroll display engine  -*- lexical-binding:t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a virtual scroll engine for displaying books/documents.
;; The main purpose of the package is to provide a continuous scrolling when
;; viewing documents.

;; The package is written in a way that it supports images/pages of different
;; sizes on the same roll (see comment above `image-roll-scroll-forward'). Also
;; there is no minumum or maximum on the range of the sizes, and finally, it is
;; written to support being displayed in (any number of) multiple windows.

;; The core functionality, i.e. the 'scroll' is provided by the
;; `image-roll-new-window-function' and `image-roll-redisplay' functions. The
;; function `image-roll-new-window-function' should be added to the
;; `image-mode-new-window-functions' while the `image-roll-redisplay' should be
;; added to the `window-configuration-change-hook' both as buffer local hook
;; functions (i.e. by passing a non-nil LOCAL argument to `add-hook'). For the
;; `image-mode-new-window-functions' to have effect, the `image-mode-winprops'
;; should be initialized by either using `image-mode-setup-winprops' (like in
;; the body of `pdf-view-mode') or by initializing the
;; `image-mode-winprops-alist' explicitly (by setting its value to nil, like in
;; the `image-roll-mode' example).

;; The package is meant to be used in combination with some other package that
;; provides features to extract and manage the data from the document. An
;; example of such a file is the file `pdf-scroll.el' at URL:
;; https://github.com/dalanicolai/pdf-tools/blob/image-roll-version/lisp/pdf-scroll.el
;; The file `pdf-scroll.el' provides the configurations for pdf-tools to work
;; with `image-roll.el'

;; However, for development purposes, the package provides an `image-roll-demo'
;; function. Also, as an example of its usage it includes a function
;; `image-roll-directory' which can be used to view all images in some directory
;; using the roll.

;; This file provides four buffer local variables that should be set to the
;; values of the functions that correctly 'retrieve' the required data from the
;; document. See their docstrings and the `image-roll-directory' function (or
;; `pdf-scroll.el') for more info.


;;; Issues

;; No real issues are known when using this package in a clean way, i.e. by
;; starting from `emacs -Q', then loading this package and using it.

;; However, I have experienced some errors in redisplay when using this package
;; in combination with vertico, marginalia and savehist. In that case sometimes
;; Emacs its `redisplay' can get a little 'confused/messed up', so that a page
;; (although never the first page but only later pages) will not show directly
;; when creating a new (second, third, ...) window. In that case `redisplay' can
;; be forced by 'activating' the minibuffer (e.g. by pressing `M-x') and hiding
;; it again. It is a weird bug, because it only happens when installing those
;; packages via `use-package', but not when the packages are installed via
;; `package-install'. Also it seems to occur mostly when these three packages
;; are combined. Additionally, it might be might 'due to' using multiple Emacs
;; versions (you can try if the issue occurs on the other Emacs version also,
;; probably not). See
;; https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-04/msg00829.html Anyway,
;; I don't know what causes the bug, but this is what I have noticed from
;; inspecting it.
